## About this
I coded this app trying to make something that people couold actually use and I did by using java Swing. I created 1 class where it runs the program but 3 others where one is GUI and looks of the program while also handle events and with simple math. The other would be handling the addition of adding expenses while also taking them away and the other are constants that would be used throughout the entire program to keep consistency.
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
